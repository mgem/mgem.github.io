#Week 9: Phase 1, Complete!

*Yes it's true - how out of the blue! It's been quite a good run: talk of digs-&-ligs, cells and serums; exploring the plate streaking (with just a bit of agar reeking)... and now we're half done!*

It's our 9th week now on [A Fledgling’s Guide to Cell Bio](http://mcmastergem.com/blog/)! From the diagram below, you can see that we've finished the left portion (plus sequencing). If you have your DNA pre-prepared, you essentially have the know-how now to go forth and create your own plasmids!

Of course, real life is ne'er so simple, and despite its grandeur we must also confront its more terrible facets. Many times, especially when working with newly-discovered or rarely-used DNA pieces, it's unlikely you'll find them readily available for ordering with the right cut sites. If you're trying to use the [BioBrick Registry of Standard Biological Parts](http://parts.igem.org/Catalog), where labs must send in and verify their parts with the correct cut sites, it's even more unlikely you'll find the part you're looking for.

But don't fret - we've got something for all these problems too! It's called Polymerase Chain Reaction (or just PCR as most people have come to call it). PCR is a technology that allows one to essentially extract and duplicate a certain gene to extreme scales. With the right techniques, PCR can be used to add prefixes, suffixes, and even mutations as well. We will be exploring the many aspects of PCR in the following weeks, at which point you'll be ready to go off unto the world and explore its wonders on your own (+supervisor)!

For now, read on as we conclude this first chapter and see to the next!

##2. Onto Phase 2
######Modern Science

Before we begin, please watch this mandatory initiation video that all synbio practitioners must know (there will be a quiz at the end): [**www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5yPkxCLads**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5yPkxCLads)

Clearly, PCR has had a large impact on the scientific community. As we go through each process of PCR design, we will explain in more depth the PCR mechanism. However, here's a brief overview to start:

1. DNA with known sequence that we want to isolate is obtained, likely in another plasmid. Sometimes several genes that we want to isolate are in the same plasmid (as it was for our mGEM 2015 project). These plasmids are known as "cassettes".
2. Primers for the PCR process are designed, ordered, and obtained. A primer is a small piece of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that is complimentary to part of the gene you want to clone from the DNA sample. The forward primer (FP) reads from the 5'-3' direction, while the reverse primer (RP) reads from the 3'-5' direction. These primers are used to allow a special DNA polymerase (*Taq* polymerase) to synthesize new DNA strands from the gene we want isolated.
3. Obtain PCR mix that includes all the reagents necessary for the PCR reaction. These include *Taq* DNA polymerase, nucleotides, and certain ions. 
4. Water, PCR mix, forward and reverse primers, and the DNA are added to a *very small* PCR tube.
5. This tube is placed inside the PCR machine.
6. The PCR machine is set to run a specific combination of temperatures, run-times, and cycles. The steps of the PCR cycles are as follows: **denature** (split the template double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) that contains the gene of interest), **anneal** (allows the primers to align with the template DNA), and **extend** (the *Taq* polymerase adds complimentary nucleotides, starting from the primers, to the template DNA). Each PCR cycle multiplies the number of the isolated gene (by using both FPs and RPs, the majority of complimentary DNA strands eventually become restricted to only the gene of interest in length). Thus, by an (almost) exponential growth, the isolated gene is produced in massive concentrations.
7. Purify the PCR content for DNA and perform gel extraction to isolate the concentrated gene of interest.

###That is the general overview of PCR! There are many specifics, but too many to mention here. But before we go, as promised, here's a...


**POP-QUIZ!!!**

1. What does the PCR machine physically do to the sample?
2. Why are primers important?
3. Has the video inspired you to take on the arts along with the sciences to broaden your understanding and appreciation of the world?

##That's all for this week! Come back next week when we begin to design our PCR primers and go over the molecular science of PCR!

######Pop-Quiz Answers: 1. Only holds and changes the tube's temperature - no direct biological modifications. 2. They allow the *Taq* polymerase to being elongation, as well restricts the cloned DNA to a specific gene sequence (instead of cloning the entire plasmid) 3. Well, that's for you to decide!
